# Term Project
<p class="year-tag">Fall 2025</p>
<hr>

## Overview

The best way to learn is to research a topic of your interest.
In this course, you will complete a research-oriented term project
focusing on computer system security,
either by yourself or in a team of two.
It is possible to form a team of three if you have strong justifications,
but please check with the instructor in advance.

To help you find a research topic,
the instructor will give a broad overview of the course and
suggest research opportunities during the first week.
Throughout the semester,
there will be several project milestones (e.g., project proposal)
that are graded as homework assignment.
The main artifact of the term project is a conference/workshop-style project report.
You will also present your findings to the class by the end of the semester.
Lastly, the instructor will advise each individual or team independently as needed.

## Milestones

* Sep 3: Form a team and send your team information to TA
* Sep 15: Project proposal due
* Oct 27: Midpoint lighting talk (during the class)
* Oct 31: Midpoint report due
* Dec 3 & 8: Final Project Presentation (during the classes)
* Dec 12: Final report due

*Note: all milestones are due by the end of the listed dates (Central Time)*

## Project Report

The final project report is a 6-page conference/workship-like paper
(*all page limits exclude references*).
Please format your report using this [LaTex template](https://github.com/ece382n-sec/Project-Report-Template).
*Note that some sections in the template are not needed for the proposal and midpoint report.*

**Proposal (<= 2 pages):**
The project proposal should describe:
(1) what research problem you or your team is trying to answer;
(2) why this problem is important;
(3) how you plan to address it;
(4) what resources you will need;
(5) what you are not sure about; and
(6) if you are working as a team,
how you plan to load balance the tasks between team members.
After submitting the proposal,
you or your team will schedule a 15-min meeting
with the instructor to discuss and possibly refine your proposal.

**Midpoint report (<= 4 pages):**
Hopefully, you and your team have some preliminary findings at this point.
This report should describe:
(1) your progress on answering the research problem;
(2) a detailed description of your approach (but not finalized);
(3) preliminary results;
(4) what the remaining tasks are and how you plan to complete them.

**Final report (<= 6 pages):**
After a semester of hard work, you will write up your findings like a research paper.
You can include supplementary materials as appendices.

**Submission instructions:** TBD


## Presentation

**Midpoint lightning talk:**
Before the mindpoint report is due,
you or your team will give a lightning talk
to share your research problem and progress with the class.
The talk duration will be determined based on the number of teams.

**Final presentation:**
You will give a conference-style talk to present your term project.
If you are working as a team,
please make sure every team member presents part of the project.
The talk length will be 12--15 minutes,
depending on the number of teams,
followed by a 5-min Q&A.
**Please send you final presentation to the instructor at least
two days before your scheduled presentation.**
