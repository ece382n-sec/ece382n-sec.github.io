## Course Overview

Welcome to "ECE 382N: Security at the Hardware-Software Interface,"
where we learn how to build secure computer systems and interesting ways to break them.
This is a research-oriented seminar course with a major term project.
We will be going over the following topics:
* Side-channel attacks and defenses
* Transient-execution attacks and defenses
* Sandboxing and isolation
* Trusted-execution environments
* Memory safety techniques
* System-level attacks in AI systems
* Other interesting emerging threats to computer systems



### Prerequisites
- ECE 312: Software Design and Implementation I (or C programming skills)
- ECE 460N: Computer Architecture
- ECE 461S: Operating Systems
- Some background in security is recommended

## Course Requirements
This course consists of a mixture of structured lectures given by the instructors
and paper presentations & discussions led by student presenters.
The expectations for all students in this course are as follows:

**Read:**
* **Lectures:**Before each lecture, students will complete a (light) pre-lecture reading and a mini quiz (*due 2 hours before each lecture*).
After each lecture, students will complete an additional in-depth post-lecture reading and
submit a conference-style paper review by the Saturday of that week (though you are encouraged to submit it by Friday).
* **Paper discussions:** Before each paper discussion session, students will read one of the papers to be discussed and submit a conference-style paper review (*due one day before the discussion*).

The reading list and details about paper review can be found [here](/schedule).

*Policy: Students can skip one pre-lecture reading and mini quiz, as well as two paper reviews without grade penalty.*

**Participate:** Students will attend every class and actively participate in class discussions.
Questions are *always* welcomed during and after the lecture.
Note that there might be pop quizzes during lectures.

*Policy: Students can skip two lectures without grade penalty.*

**Present:** Students will present research papers and lead the discussion during the paper discussion sessions. The presentation guideline will be discussed during the class, as it depends on the course enrollment.

**Research:** Students will conduct a term research project in system security.
Both attack and defense projects are welcomed.
More details about the term project can be found [here](/project).

## Grading

As a research-oriented course, there will be no exams :).
Your grade will be largely determined by the term project and class participation,
with an optional lab (totaling 105%).
* 5%: Class participation
* 5%: Pre-lecture reading and mini quizzes
* 15%: Post-lecture reading and pre-discussion paper reviews
* 20%: Leading paper discussion
* 60%: Term project =
    * (3%: Project proposal) +
    * (7%: Midpoint report) +
    * (15%: Final presentation) +
    * (35%: Final report)


## Other Course Policies
Students are expected to adhere to the [Standards of Conduct](https://deanofstudents.utexas.edu/conduct/standardsofconduct.php).
Please do not cheat, it is not worth it.
This course also has the following additional policies.

### Use of AI Tools
Generative AI tools such as ChatGPT and Claude have become widespread.
Hype aside, these tools are indeed transforming the way we retrieve and process information.
It is therefore crucial to learn how to effectively use these tools in our research---while maintaining academic integrity and avoiding intellectual dishonesty.
The general policy for this course regarding the use of AI tools is that **it is acceptable to retrieve and process information, but not to create original content**.
Here are some examples (though not an exhaustive list):

#### Allowed
<ul>
<li class="allowed">Find related work</li>
<li class="allowed">Clarify a confusing concept (but please be aware of hallucinations)</li>
<li class="allowed">Proof read your draft for grammar errors</li>
</ul>

#### Prohibited
<ul>
<li class="blocked">Complete mini quizzes or write paper reviews</li>
<li class="blocked">Write the project proposal, checkpoint reports, and the final report</li>
<li class="blocked">"Vide code" the lab</li>
</ul>

Confirmed violations can result in receiving an "F" for this course.

### Hacking Ethics & Legal Considerations
In this course, you will learn about vulnerabilities in computer systems.
However, you **must not** attack other people's computers, access systems without authorization,
or misuse personal information---doing so can lead to serious legal consequences.
Be extra mindful of ethical and legal issues if you are working on any attack-focused term project.
When in doubt, please reach out to the course instructor.
