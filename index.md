## Course Overview

Welcome to "ECE 382N: Security at the Hardware-Software Interface,"
where we learn how to build secure computer systems and interesting ways to break them.
This is a research-oriented seminar course with a major term project.
We will be going over the following topics:
* Side-channel attacks and defenses
* Transient-execution attacks and defenses
* Sandboxing and isolation
* Trusted-execution environments
* Memory safety techniques
* System-level attacks in AI systems
* Other interesting emerging threats to computer systems

### Prerequisites
- ECE 312(H): Software Design and Implementation I (or C programming skills)
- ECE 460N: Computer Architecture
- ECE 461S: Operating Systems
- Some background in security is recommended

## Course Requirements
The expectations for all students in this course are as follows:

**Read:** Students will complete a (light) pre-lecture reading and a mini quiz **before each lecture**.
At the end of each week, students will complete an additional in-depth post-lecture reading and submit a conference-style paper review **before the next lecture**.
The reading list and details about paper review can be found [here](/schedule).

*Policy: Students can skip a week-worth of reading assignments (i.e., two pre-lecture readings and one post-lecture reading) without grade penalty.*

**Participate:** Students will attend every class and actively participate in class discussions.
Questions are *always* welcomed during and after the lecture.
Note that there might be pop quizzes during lectures.

*Policy: Students can skip two lectures without grade penalty.*

**Research:** Students will conduct a term research project in system security.
Both attack and defense projects are welcomed.
More details about the term project can be found [here](/project).

## Grading

As a research-oriented course, there will be no exams :).
Your grade will be largely determined by the term project and class participation,
with an optional lab (totaling 110%).
* 10%: Pre-lecture reading and mini quizzes
* 15%: Post-lecture reading and paper reviews
* 10%: Class participation
* 65%: Term project =
    * (3%: Project proposal) +
    * (6%: Midpoint lightning talk) +
    * (6%: Midpoint report) +
    * (15%: Final presentation) +
    * (35%: Final report)
* 10%: Optional lab
* Extra bonus points for correcting errors in this course


## Other Course Policies
Students are expected to adhere to the [Standards of Conduct](https://deanofstudents.utexas.edu/conduct/standardsofconduct.php).
Please do not cheat, it is not worth it.
This course also has the following additional policies.

### Use of AI Tools
Generative AI tools such as ChatGPT and Claude have become widespread.
Hype aside, these tools are indeed transforming the way we retrieve and process information.
It is therefore crucial to learn how to effectively use these tools in our research---while maintaining academic integrity and avoiding intellectual dishonesty.
The general policy for this course regarding the use of AI tools is that **it is acceptable to retrieve and process information, but not to create original content**.
Here are some examples (though not an exhaustive list):

#### Allowed
<ul>
<li class="allowed">Find related work</li>
<li class="allowed">Clarify a confusing concept (but please be aware of hallucinations)</li>
<li class="allowed">Proof read your draft for grammar errors</li>
</ul>

#### Prohibited
<ul>
<li class="blocked">Complete mini quizzes or write paper reviews</li>
<li class="blocked">Write the project proposal, checkpoint reports, and the final report</li>
<li class="blocked">"Vide code" the lab</li>
</ul>

Confirmed violations can result in receiving an "F" for this course.

### Hacking Ethics & Legal Considerations
In this course, you will learn about vulnerabilities in computer systems.
However, you **must not** attack other people's computers, access systems without authorization,
or misuse personal information---doing so can lead to serious legal consequences.
Be extra mindful of ethical and legal issues if you are working on any attack-focused term project.
When in doubt, please reach out to the course instructor.
